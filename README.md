This is the first project on the front-end development path from codeacademy
It's a cheat sheet for HTML and CSS. I used dark colors so it's easy to read and to be able to study with it. 
All main HTML elements are here and the css review of everything that you see on the path it's in a liked PDF at the end. :)
